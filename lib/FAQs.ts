    "question": "What factors affect the price of a move in Sharjah?",
    "answer": "The final cost of your move is determined by several key factors. The primary determinants are the volume of your belongings (e.g., the difference between a studio and a multi-bedroom villa), the distance of the move, and the level of service you require. Additional services, such as specialized handling for fragile items, piano moving, or requests for a full packing and unpacking service, can also influence the total cost. Furthermore, factors like the number of helpers and trucks needed, and whether the move involves climbing multiple flights of stairs, will be accounted for in the final quote."
